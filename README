After a search of waveform generator, I decided to create it myself because I had an urgent need.

This CAN draw On Any Generator Graphics.

Actually only PCM (Singed and unsigned) Will Work
8bit, 16bit, 24bit
mono, stereo

Edit:
Based on Interval Music Compositor, I have add some decoder to be able to process Ogg, Mp3, Flac (16bit only) and Aac 

Others formats has not yet Been Tested.

You Can try to start runTest in default package to see a Window Showing a Waveform Panel. Try to load a WAV file. The Waveform Displayed IS ounce You Can Zoom in and out With The mousewheel. Try to resize aussi The Window.
